# Updates

2021/Oct/07 - FastQC  
2021/Sept/06 - (Sorry for the long idle) FastQC  
2021/Aug/15 - Starting with the samtools section.   
2021/Aug/15 - Start to log updates  
2021/July/a day hit badly by summer heat - Started this repository  

It was late July 2021 when I first initiate this repository. I did not realize how the rapid change of the field could impact this writing, as in I know things are moving fast but little do I realize something merely 2 years old could be so obsoleted that one has to read the manuals to learn the old tricks again. This causes me to extensively modify my existing entries and make me cautious when suggesting readings and making remarks. Anyway there is one thing I can be very sure of: I am not going to update this repository once RNA-Seq or Genome big data analysis became something like molecular cloning to me. Nor do I have the obligation to keep this relevant for an extented period of time, so I decided to mark the updates here and don't take things too literal if at the time when you come, I haven't been touching things for more than 1 year.

# Who is going to read this

This is a repo for molecular biologists in any disciplines to learn how to use computer as a tool to do basic science. You will need to be fluent in molecular biology and classical basic science to understand me. And the next thing would be an open mind. To see things past what they are and customize the usage to suit yourself and serve humanity. This is the definition of tool.

Those who want to leave academia and work in industrial sector might also want to comb through the writings, to get an idea of why some colleagues are having hard time in getting jobs outside of University or research institutes.  

# Genomic data science as a tool to biologist

I believe that science is all about hypothesis testing. But the hypothesis that I am talking about here is a bit different from the way statisticians would like to put. For example,

![null-hypothesis](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30200862/136685805-b14ea82b-ece5-4376-b5d8-3c2a1eee8452.png)

Wait a second, what's the deal here? They could be essentially the same at some level. So the criticality lies in how to vaildate the conclusion. For the former I might want to perform any sort of quantifiable PCR to vaildate the expression, but for the latter I would like to see what if I use other treatment and what if I assess at different molecular level such as protein and/or other clinically/physiologically related phenotype.

I am not saying who is better than who, I am saying that we should all work together. In my journey of self-educating to use the NGS tools, Mathematicians tends to create new terminology to suit their needs on some well-known "things", such as the "summarizing transcriptome to gene level" conversion used widely in DESeq2 related discussion. So sometimes I am also confused, in which line of professions or methodology that I am using to solve a natural science question which is universal to every single living things on the Earth. I mean, should I even need to worry about that when if we all are heading to the same Rome? 

# What was I doing and what you could observe

In this repo I plan to start from setting up the computer to visualizing data. I am making this Github as my log book in doing so. And cause I believe that the marriage between my solid basic science training and this powerful tool would be gorgeous so I will, along my way, includes the scientific reasoning/experimental design where deems necessary, thus the repo title. Nevertheless I am working for a pharmaceutical entity and these projects are confidential in nature so please excuse my ambiguity from time to time.

Like many others I have tried to skip the trouble by using web application such as GERIN or more famous and resourceful Galaxy but at the end of the day geek are all more comfortable with things made by our own hands (under our full control) especially I am not a total stranger to machine language. The freedom that I can immerse into the sea of R package on Bioconductor amazes me that I am not letting this go. I think we are all trying to get the best out of our some 70 years on this planet, aren't we?

I am not confining myself to RNA-Seq but I consider this is a pretty good start in bioinformatics. Expect branches to other NGS or even a new repository under my account. This is also the nature of working in commercial research - that you will be working on multiple projects on short notice with impossible time frame. This is what actually pushed me into computational biology. Destiny. 

One can also see this as a diary of a struggling hard-core natural scientist who transited from academia to industry, and trying to transform the (my) infrastructure to adapt to the change of the world. Not to become someone else, but a better man. 

By the way I am open for hiring from start-up to global renowned pharmaceuticals/personal care/FMCG entities. Feel free to contact me for a discussion.
