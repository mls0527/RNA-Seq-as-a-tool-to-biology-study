# Who is going to read this

This is a repo for molecular biologists in any disciplines to learn how to use computer as a tool to do basic science. You will need to be fluent in molecular biology and classical basic science to understand me. And the next thing would be an open mind. To see things past what they are and customize the usage to suit yourself and serve humanity. This is the definition of tool.

Those who wants to leave academia and work in industrial sector might also want to comb through the writings, to get an idea of why some colleagues are having hard time in getting jobs outside of University or research institutes.  

# RNA-Seq as a tool to biologist

I believe that science is all about hypothesis testing. But the hypothesis testing that I am talking about here is a bit different from the way statisticians would like to put. For example 

>You want to test a hypothesis that each day, fraction, and diet will contain genes that are signicantly different under varying treatments. How does the sequencing facility organization and the organization of files for your analysis differ? What about the naming of the files? Are they useful to you? Draw a data organization structure that you would recommend.

This is not the hypothesis that I am talking about. I would say, for this very topic, the question could have been how do I treat cancer. And one of the hypothesis, which based on the premise that a lot of previous data had shown that gene A is critical in modifying the prognosis, that the treatment I am giving to this living thing could change the expression of protein A which is templated by gene A and I see a difference in the prognosis. This is what called reductionism. Because I am ignoring all the other genes in the same pathway or their association with differential expression of gene A. So I decided to ride on the power of genome wide sequencing that I want to do a RNA-Seq to make it more holistic. In other words, RNA-Seq is just a tool to help me to test the original hypothesis in another perspective and adopting it should pose NO effect to my hypothesis forming. BUT IT DOES provide evidence for my subsequent hypothesis refinement. RNA-Seq, or other NGS, is powerful but one of the experiment tools in doing scientific investigation, and that is it. The hypothesis that I quote above is useful in setting up the null hypothesis in interpretating p-value and/or q-value but plesae do not get it backwards.

In this repo I plan to start from setting up the computer to visualizing data. I am making this Github as my log book in doing so. And cause I believe that the marriage between my solid basic science training and this powerful bioinformatics tool would be gorgeous so I will, along my way, includes the scientific reasoning/experimental design where deems necessary, thus the repo title. Nevertheless I am working for a pharmaceutical entity and these projects are confidential in nature so please excuse my ambiguity from time to time.

Like many others I have tried to skip the trouble by using web application such as GERIN or more famous and resourceful Galaxy but at the end of the day geek are all more comfortable with things made by our own hands (under our full control) especially I am not a total stranger to machine language. The freedom that I can immerse into the sea of R package on Bioconductor amazes me that I am not letting this go. I think we are all trying to get the best out of our some 70 years on this planet, aren't we?

I am not confining myself to RNA-Seq but I consider this is a pretty good start in bioinformatics. Expect branches to other NGS or even a new repository under my account. This is also the nature of working in commercial research - that you will be working on multiple projects on short notice with impossible time frame. This is what actually pushed me into computational biology. Destiny. 

One can also see this as a diary of a struggling hard-core natural scientist who transited from academia to industry, and trying to transform the infrastructure to adapt to the change of the world. Not to become someone else, but a better man. 

By the way I am open for hiring from start-up to global renowned pharmaceuticals/personal care/FMCG entities. Feel free to contact me for a discussion.
