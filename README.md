## RNA-Seq as a tool to biologist

This is a repo for molecular biologists in any disciplines to learn how to use computer as a tool to do basic science. 

Starting from setting up the computer to visualizing data. I am making this Github as my log book in doing so. And cause I believe that the marriage between my solid basic science training and this powerful bioinformatics tool would be gorgeous so I will, along my way, includes the scientific reasoning/experimental design in steps which deems necessary, thus the repo title. Nevertheless I am working for a pharmaceutical entity and these projects are confidential in nature so please excuse my ambiguity from time to time.

Like many others I have tried to skip the trouble by using web application such as GERIN or more famous and resourceful Galaxy but at the end of the day geek are all more comfortable with things made by our own hands especially I am not a total stranger to programming. I think we are all trying to get the best out of our some 70 years on this planet, aren't we?

I am not confining myself to RNA-Seq but I consider this is a pretty good start in bioinformatics. Expect branches to other NGS or even a new repository under my account. This is also the nature of working in commercial research - that you will be working on multiple projects on short notice with impossible time frame. This is what actually pushed me into computational biology. Destiny. 

By the way I am open for hiring from start-up to global renowned pharmaceuticals/personal care product manufacturers. Feel free to contact me for a discussion.
