# Who is going to read this

This is a repo for molecular biologists in any disciplines to learn how to use computer as a tool to do basic science. You will need to be fluent in molecular biology, classic basic science to understand me. And the next thing would be an open mind. To see things past what they are and customize the usage to suit yourself and serve humanity. This is the definition of tool.

Those who wants to leave academia and work in industrial sector might also want to comb through the writings, to get an idea of why some colleagues are having hard time in getting jobs outside of University or research institutes.  

# RNA-Seq as a tool to biologist

Starting from setting up the computer to visualizing data. I am making this Github as my log book in doing so. And cause I believe that the marriage between my solid basic science training and this powerful bioinformatics tool would be gorgeous so I will, along my way, includes the scientific reasoning/experimental design in steps which deems necessary, thus the repo title. Nevertheless I am working for a pharmaceutical entity and these projects are confidential in nature so please excuse my ambiguity from time to time.

Like many others I have tried to skip the trouble by using web application such as GERIN or more famous and resourceful Galaxy but at the end of the day geek are all more comfortable with things made by our own hands especially I am not a total stranger to programming. I think we are all trying to get the best out of our some 70 years on this planet, aren't we?

I am not confining myself to RNA-Seq but I consider this is a pretty good start in bioinformatics. Expect branches to other NGS or even a new repository under my account. This is also the nature of working in commercial research - that you will be working on multiple projects on short notice with impossible time frame. This is what actually pushed me into computational biology. Destiny. 

One can also see this as a diary of a struggling hard-core natural scientist who transited from academia to industry, and trying to transform the infrastructure to adapt to the change of the world. Not to become someone else, but a better man. 

By the way I am open for hiring from start-up to global renowned pharmaceuticals/personal care product manufacturers. Feel free to contact me for a discussion.
